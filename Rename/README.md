# Rename

Rename any Swift type in your project. A simple workaround for the "Can't refactor Swift code" dialog in Xcode.

**Example**

Run in the root folder of your project to replace a given string with another in all Swift source files:
```
$ marathon run ~/scripts/rename.swift MyType MyNewType
```
